## Overview
**SCID** is a **S**and **C**ontrol **I**nstallation **D**ecision-making software designed for Production and other Energy experts 
for faster and reliable decision making on whether to install Sand Control facilities or not. 

It's credibility is attributed to it's vast factor considerations leveraging various information of the well 
such as; 
1. Reservoir Characteristics
2. Production information
3. Completion types
4. Environmental impact information
5. Economic feasibility information

**Note**: This project is part of a Test Project for a Petroleum Engineering Graduate internship position at CypherCrescent. 

  ## Tools
  This project was built on purely **Python** and **Streamlit** (for the UI). 

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Ekeopara-Praise/Sand-Control-Installation-App.git
```
```
pip install streamlit
```
Now on the terminal, in the file directory, run
```
streamlit run SCID_App.py
```
